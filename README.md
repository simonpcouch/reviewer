# reviewer

As if a member of the tidyverse team were there with you to workshop
your code for reproducibility, readability, and resilience:

<img src="inst/reviewer-sc.png" alt="A code editor containing R code with a panel on the right showing a comment from 'Tidy reviewer'. On the left, the workspace setup section loads various libraries including tidyverse, extraDistr, MASS, cmdstanr, and bayesplot. Three lines (tidyr, purrr, and ggplot2) are highlighted in red, indicating they've been flagged. The 'Tidy Reviewer' panel displays feedback explaining that these three packages are redundant because tidyverse already includes them, suggesting their removal to simplify dependencies." width="100%" />
