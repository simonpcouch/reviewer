On the left, the workspace setup section loads various libraries including tidyverse, extraDistr, MASS, cmdstanr, and bayesplot. Three lines (tidyr, purrr, and ggplot2) are highlighted in red, indicating they’ve been flagged. The ‘Tidy Reviewer’ panel displays feedback explaining that these three packages are redundant because tidyverse already includes them, suggesting their removal to simplify dependencies." />
