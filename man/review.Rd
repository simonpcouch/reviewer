\title{Review an R script with an LLM}
\usage{
review(file_path, client = NULL, max_pending = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to the R file to review.}

\item{client}{The model to use for the review, either as an \link[ellmer:Chat]{ellmer::Chat}
object or a \code{"provider/model"} string in the same format accepted by
\code{\link[ellmer:chat-any]{ellmer::chat()}}. If not provided, the \code{reviewer.client} option will be
consulted. See \link{reviewer_options} for details. If neither are present,
the user will be shown an interactive dialog to select a client.}

\item{max_pending}{Maximum number of pending edits allowed at once before the
model waits for user responses. Higher values reduce wait time but may
feel more overwhelming. If not provided, the \code{reviewer.pending_edits}
option is used. Defaults to 2.}
}
\value{
The function's main purpose is its side-effect, a Docs-style
interface opened in the browser. On app close, the \link[ellmer:Chat]{ellmer::Chat} object
used for the review session is returned invisibly. The underlying chat object
is stored as \code{.last_review} on the search path for easy access after review.
}
\description{
Launches an interactive Shiny app where an LLM reviews your R code and
suggests improvements for reproducibility, readability, and resilience.
The app displays your code with proposed edits highlighted inline. You can
accept or reject each suggestion, and accepted edits are applied to the
file immediately.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set the client option (possibly in your .Rprofile)
options(reviewer.client = ellmer::chat_claude(model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"))
review("analysis.R")

# Or pass the client directly
review("script.R", client = "openai/gpt-5")
review("script.R", client = ellmer::chat_openai(model = "gpt-5"))
}
