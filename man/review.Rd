\title{Review an R script with an LLM}
\usage{
review(file_path, model = NULL, max_pending = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to the R file to review.}

\item{model}{The model to use for the review, specified as a
\code{"provider/model"} string in the same format as \code{\link[ellmer:chat-any]{ellmer::chat()}}.
If not provided, the \code{reviewer.chat} option must be set.
See \link{reviewer_options} for details.}

\item{max_pending}{Maximum number of pending edits allowed at once before the
model waits for user responses. Higher values reduce wait time but may
feel more overwhelming and risk edit conflicts. If not provided, the
\code{reviewer.pending_edits} option is used. Defaults to 2.}
}
\value{
The function's main purpose is its side-effect, a Docs-style
interface opened in the browser. On app close, the \link[ellmer:Chat]{ellmer::Chat} object
used for the review session is returned (invisibly).
}
\description{
Launches an interactive Shiny app where an LLM reviews your R code and
suggests improvements for reproducibility, readability, and resilience.
The app displays your code with proposed edits highlighted inline. You can
accept or reject each suggestion, and accepted edits are applied to the
file immediately.
