# reviewer

Human-scale LLM code review, as if a member of the tidyverse team were there with you to workshop your code for reproducibility, readability, and resilience:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|   A code editor containing R code with a panel on the right showing a comment
#|   from 'Tidy reviewer'. On the left, the workspace setup section loads various
#|   libraries including tidyverse, extraDistr, MASS, cmdstanr, and bayesplot.
#|   Three lines (tidyr, purrr, and ggplot2) are highlighted in red, indicating
#|   they've been flagged. The 'Tidy Reviewer' panel displays feedback explaining
#|   that these three packages are redundant because tidyverse already includes
#|   them, suggesting their removal to simplify dependencies.

```

This project is highly experimental; expect many rough edges.

## Installation

Install reviewer from GitHub with:

```r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/reviewer")
```

## Usage

To review an R script:

```r
library(reviewer)
review("path/to/your/script.R")
```

This opens a Shiny app where you can accept or reject the suggested improvements to your code.

If you haven't yet configured a client to use with reviewer, `review()` will present you with an interactive menu of possible models to use based on the environment variables you have available. You can use any model provider supported by [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/). 

I've had good experiences with using Claude Sonnet 4.5 as a client. To change models, set the `review(client)` argument or the `reviewer.client` option to an ellmer chat.
