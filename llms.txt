# reviewer

Human-scale LLM code review, as if a member of the tidyverse team were
there with you to workshop your code for reproducibility, readability,
and resilience:

![A code editor containing R code with a panel on the right showing a
comment from 'Tidy reviewer'. On the left, the workspace setup section
loads various libraries including tidyverse, extraDistr, MASS, cmdstanr,
and bayesplot. Three lines (tidyr, purrr, and ggplot2) are highlighted
in red, indicating they've been flagged. The 'Tidy Reviewer' panel
displays feedback explaining that these three packages are redundant
because tidyverse already includes them, suggesting their removal to
simplify
dependencies.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonpcouch/reviewer/refs/heads/main/inst/reviewer-sc.png)

This project is highly experimental; expect many rough edges.

## Installation

Install reviewer from GitHub with:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/reviewer")
```

## Usage

To review an R script:

``` r
library(reviewer)
review("path/to/your/script.R")
```

This opens a Shiny app where you can accept or reject the suggested
improvements to your code.

If you haven’t yet configured a client to use with reviewer,
[`review()`](https://simonpcouch.github.io/reviewer/reference/review.md)
will present you with an interactive menu of possible models to use
based on the environment variables you have available. You can use any
model provider supported by [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/).

I’ve had good experiences with using Claude Sonnet 4.5 as a client. To
change models, set the `review(client)` argument or the
`reviewer.client` option to an ellmer chat.
