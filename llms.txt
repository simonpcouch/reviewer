# reviewer

As if a member of the tidyverse team were there with you to workshop
your code for reproducibility, readability, and resilience:

![A code editor containing R code with a panel on the right showing a
comment from 'Tidy reviewer'. On the left, the workspace setup section
loads various libraries including tidyverse, extraDistr, MASS, cmdstanr,
and bayesplot. Three lines (tidyr, purrr, and ggplot2) are highlighted
in red, indicating they've been flagged. The 'Tidy Reviewer' panel
displays feedback explaining that these three packages are redundant
because tidyverse already includes them, suggesting their removal to
simplify
dependencies.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonpcouch/reviewer/refs/heads/master/inst/reviewer-sc.png)

> \[!NOTE\] This project is highly experimental and was vibe-coded over

## Installation

Install reviewer from GitHub with:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/reviewer")
```

## Authentication

You can use any model provider supported by
[ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/).

If you’re connecting to a model provider by API key, add your API key to
your `.Renviron`.

See the ellmer
[authentication](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/#authentication)
documentation for more details.

## Usage

To review an R script:

``` r
library(reviewer)
review("path/to/your/script.R")
```

This opens a Shiny app where you can accept or reject the suggested
improvements to your code.

By default,
[`review()`](https://simonpcouch.github.io/reviewer/reference/review.md)
uses Claude Sonnet 4.5. To change models, provide a `provider/model`
string in the same manner you would to
[`ellmer::chat()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat-any.html)
to the `model` argument:

``` r
review("path/to/your/script.R", model = "openai/gpt-5")
```
